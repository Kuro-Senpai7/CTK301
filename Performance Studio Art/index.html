<!-- A-Frame and AR.js Libraries:

The A-Frame library is included via its CDN to provide the framework for 3D rendering.
The ar-threex-location-only.js script is included for handling AR functionality with location-based tracking.
The aframe-ar.js script integrates AR.js with A-Frame for easy AR scene creation.
<a-scene> Element:

This is the main container for the A-Frame scene.
The arjs='sourceType: webcam;' attribute tells AR.js to use the webcam as the input source.
<a-marker> Element:

This specifies the AR marker to use. In this example, preset="hiro" uses the Hiro marker, which is one of the standard AR.js markers.
3D Object:

Inside the <a-marker> element, an <a-box> is defined. This box will be rendered in AR when the Hiro marker is detected.
Camera:

The <a-entity camera> element sets up a basic camera for the scene. -->
